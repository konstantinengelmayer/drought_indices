# R Script for Downloading and Processing Climate Data from DWD

# Description:
# This script automates the download, extraction, and processing of monthly climate data from the German Weather Service (DWD) Open Data portal. It:
# - Downloads monthly data for specified climate variables (e.g., precipitation, evaporation, air temperature max) over a defined period.
# - Extracts compressed files and removes the original archives to save space.
# - Processes the extracted data into raster stacks with appropriate time stamps and coordinate reference systems.
# - Saves the merged raster data for further analysis.

# Workflow Overview:
# 1. **Library Loading**:
#    - Imports necessary libraries (`dplyr`, `R.utils`, `terra`) for data manipulation and processing.

# 2. **Parameter Definition**:
#    - Defines the years and months for which data will be downloaded.
#    - Specifies the climate variables to be processed along with their corresponding URLs and file naming patterns.

# 3. **Data Download and Extraction**:
#    - Creates a generalized function to download data for each variable.
#    - Loops through the variables, years, and months to download all relevant files.
#    - Extracts the downloaded `.gz` files and removes the archives.

# 4. **Data Processing**:
#    - For each climate variable:
#      - Lists the extracted `.asc` files.
#      - Loads them into a raster stack.
#      - Assigns appropriate dates to each raster layer based on the filenames.
#      - Sets the coordinate reference system to EPSG:31467.
#      - Saves the merged raster stack to a `.tif` file.

# Notes:
# - Adjust the `variables` list to include or exclude climate variables as needed.
# - Make sure the `data` directory structure exists or adjust the paths accordingly.
# - use_month_names checks if the file of the climate variables are within months folder or not

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(R.utils) # For gunzip function
library(terra)   # For raster processing
